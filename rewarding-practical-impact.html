        Rewarding practical impact
      </h2>
        <p>
          If there are hazards to requiring that research has practical impact, but also hazards to ignoring the practical impact of research, what should be done?  Researchers should be rewarded for the practical impact of their research.  This makes practical impact important, without making it so important that it hampers the free exploration that is vital to research.

        <p>
          Without some sort of reward for practical impact, there is little incentive for researchers to spend time encouraging or nurturing the practical impact of their work.  Without the sorts of rewards that they get for presenting at academic conferences, or writing for academic journals, researchers won't spend their time and energy presenting at practitioner conferences, or writing for practitioner journals (<a href="references.html#latham2007">Latham 2007</a>).
