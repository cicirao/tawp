        Altmetrics breaks out of academic silo that isolates most bibliometric methods
        </h3>
          <p>
            “Altmetrics” can refer to either the specific research-metric product from Altmetrics, LLC, or to any metric which uses data from outside of the databases of academic journals used by most, if not all, citation-based metrics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both of those sorts of “altmetrics” have the potential to capture some of the practical impact of research, as they are not designed to exclusively use data from academia.  But they also don't exclude data from academia, either, which can obscure evidence of practical impact with the social chatter of academicians.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, while methods for tracking the impact of research that use data passively provided by both researchers and practitioners (e.g., readership analysis), break out of the academia-only restriction that is inherent with a reliance on rigorous citations for evidence of impact, they also dilute the impact on practitioners in the flood of data from academics.
          </p>
          <p>
            An example is the study by Mohammadi et al. (2014) on Mendeley readership data.  As the authors explain, “Although the Mendeley API provides information related to the discipline, academic status and country of readers for each record, it only reports percentages rather than raw data and only gives information about the top three categories.”  So, if one of the top three categories of readers isn't a practitioner category, almost no information about an articles impact on practice is available.
