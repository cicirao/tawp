        Hazards of making practical value requisite
      </h2>
        <p>
          If it is hazardous to ignore the practical impact of research, then should it not be required that all research have some practical impact?  A form of this requirement was proposed by <a href="references.html">Mitroff (1998)</a>, who claimed that any research without practical impact was not <i>true</i>, and therefore shouldn't be published.  To explain why practical impact is a requirement for truth he wrote:
        <p>
          <div class="quote">
          <p>
            <a class="invisible" href="references.html">Pragmatism is the philosophical school that posits that truth is that which makes a significant difference in the lives of humans. Something&mdash;an action, empirical finding, proposition, conjecture, theorem—that is true in theory (i.e., in the abstract only) but makes no difference in the lives of humans is not a truth for pragmatism. Thus, contrary to what many academics believe, truth is not solely a property of formal propositions, theorems, research findings, and so forth but of ethical actions (i.e., actions that eliminate, or make significant headway in eliminating, some important human problem).</a>
          </p>
          </div>
        <p>
          The most obvious problem with requiring practical impact for research is that it would block research into the fundamental laws and principles that underlie every field.  It would hamper research that attempted to synthesize general solutions to groups of related specific problems, since the general solution might “be broad and theoretical and… difficult to apply” (<a href="references.html">Hunlin 2001</a>).
