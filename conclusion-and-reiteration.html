        Conclusion / Reiteration

        <p>
          Bibliometric methods are well established and widely used, but they reinforce the isolation of academic research from real-world practice.  That isolation has a number of consequences that include: the proliferation of trivial empirical studies; the failure of practitioners to benefit from the knowledge gains of researchers; and the increasingly skeptical scrutiny of the public funding of research.
        </p>
        <p>
          While requiring practical impact of academic research is both unlikely to be adopted and hazardous to the ongoing advancement of knowledge, the practical impact of research must be rewarded before researchers can be expected to look for and exploit opportunities for achieving practical impact in their research.
        </p>
        <p>
          Effective reward systems will require effective means of tracking the practical impact of research.  Current bibliometric and altmetric methodologies fail to capture practical impact in anything more than a glancing manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          An effective practical impact metric could draw data from a number of paths, including social media and readership information.  It would rank the practical impact of research with three non-quantitative levels: Unknown, Apparent and Important.  The distinction between the “A” and “I” levels would be based on comparisons within a field, to avoid disparities between fields that have inherently different potentials for practical impact, and established behaviors that might skew the tracking of practical impact.
